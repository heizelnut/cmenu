install
-------
 $ make
 # make install                         # requires sudo/doas
 $ make install PREFIX=~/.local         # installs for user

for other actions see the Makefile.

why
---
I was always fascinated by the `dired` feature in emacs, but I couldn't find
any standalone program which could be run from the terminal without an emacs
daemon running in the background and with vi bindings.
Then I realized I could just build a simpler and more general purpose program,
following the unix philosophy and chaining more programs together to implement
`dired` in POSIX shell.

what does it do
---------------
It acts pretty much like fzf and dmenu, but it's brutally simple.

examples
--------
`dired` - directory navigator

license
-------
Most of the code to control the terminal has been borrowed and readjusted from
antirez/kilo, which is licensed under the same license (BSD 2-Clause).

Grazie Salvatore, mo devo offrirti una birra.

inspiration
-----------
GNU Emacs - dired mode
github.com/antirez/kilo - a small C terminal editor in 1000 LOC
